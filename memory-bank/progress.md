# Progress

## What Works

- Isometric city grid is rendered using two canvas layers.
- Users can select tile types and place them on the grid.
- Right-click context menu allows for removing tiles and adding/editing labels.
- Labels are stored per tile and persisted in localStorage.
- Labels are now drawn on the foreground canvas and are visible above the tiles.
- Map state is saved and loaded from localStorage, supporting both new and legacy formats.
- "Kaart Wissen" (Clear Map) button resets the map after confirmation and is fixed at the bottom right.
- All user-facing text is in Dutch.

## What's Left to Build

- Further UI/UX polish (e.g., mobile responsiveness, accessibility).
- Optional: Export/import map data for sharing.
- Optional: More advanced tile types or features (roads, water, etc).
- Optional: Undo/redo functionality.

## Current Status

- Core features (tile placement, removal, labeling, persistence, clear) are implemented and working.
- All major bugs (label visibility, persistence, clear logic) have been addressed.
- Memory bank documentation is up to date with the current state of the project.

## Known Issues

- No backend or cloud sync; all data is local to the browser.
- No multi-user or collaborative features.
- No authentication or user accounts.
- No advanced editing tools (copy/paste, multi-select, etc).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Migrated from URL hash state to localStorage for better persistence and UX.
- Switched from drawing labels on the background canvas to a dedicated foreground layer for visibility.
- Adopted a memory bank structure for project documentation and context.
- All new features and fixes are documented in the memory bank as they are implemented.
